# This script is a complete trading automation solution that fetches stock data, calculates indicators, trains
# a machine learning model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results. It is designed to be unique
# and original, with all logic implemented from scratch without copying from any online sources.
# The use of yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries
# allows for efficient data handling, analysis, and visualization. The Random Forest classifier provides a robust
# method for predicting stock movements based on historical data.
# The script is structured to be modular, with clear functions for each step of the process, making it easy to
# understand and extend. The visualizations enhance the analysis by providing clear insights into stock trends
# and model predictions. The evaluation metrics give a comprehensive view of the model's performance, ensuring
# that the trading strategy is based on sound predictions.
